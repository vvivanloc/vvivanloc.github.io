# Vincent V. website - readme

This website is based on [Start Bootstrap - Freelancer v3.3.7+1](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer).

# How to build this site

This procedure was tested on Lubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial Xerus on March 2017.

The *Start Bootstrap* template is built with Gulp and use some optional scripts written in TypeScript. You may use built files in the *dist* folder but if you want to change the template style or add some scripting, you need to install these tools to build the site.

1. Install nodejs

[Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 

It is necessary for the package manager named npm. This later and the following required tools are written entirely in JavaScript and depends very heavily on Node.js APIs. 

Go to NodeJs website and follow the [instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions).

For convenience, the commands are presented below.
```
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```

2. Install gulp

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is an automating toolkit. You may use Python or Webpack, *-insert your favorite batch tool here-* but since the *Start Bootstrap* template is built with gulp, you have to use it.

*Why a global install then a link ? To prevent wasting space by duplicating the gulp within the local node_modules folder.*

- start a command line interface
- cd  <website_local_directory>

```
sudo npm install -g gulp
sudo npm link gulp
```

A node_modules/gulp folder should appear.

3. Install the following gulp plugins

- gulp-less
- browser-sync
- gulp-header
- gulp-clean-css
- gulp-rename
- gulp-uglify
- gulp-typescript
- gulp-sourcemaps 
- gulp-concat

```
sudo npm install -g gulp-plugin-name
sudo npm link gulp-plugin-name
```

4. Install TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to JavaScript. Enjoy typing & ES 2017 latest features on every browser and on Node.js! 

```
sudo npm install -g typescript
```

5. Build the site

All the tools have been installed now. You have to build the site.
The bootstrap template relies on [less](http://lesscss.org/) for styling and some js code.

- start a command line interface
- the tsc command transpile TypeScript: *.map and *.js files should 
appear in the js folder
- the gulp command concat & minify the stylesheet and script files :
  - a folder named *dist* should appear 
  - with two files: js/scripts.min.js & css/freelancer.min.css

```
cd  <website_local_directory>
tsc
gulp 
```

The following messages should appear in the console.
```
...
[10:16:56] Starting 'default'...
[10:16:56] Finished 'default' after 36 μs
```

- for easier development, you can pop out a browser window in which content will be sync each time you do and save a modification in any styling (less) or content (html) files.

```
gulp dev
```

# Bugs

The typescript process is not integrated with gulp.

- Since the typescript file map cannot be matched with gulp minified version, you have to use the non minified version for debugging.
- Gulp breaks at each typescript compilation error.
